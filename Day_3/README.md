### Day 3 (Cython Tutorials)

Some of these tutorials require a C++ and Fortran compiler. On most linux distributions gcc/g++/gfortran (GNU Compiler Collection) should already be installed. To check this run `gcc --version` in a terminal. On MacOS you can check that you have a compiler with `clang --version`. The clang/clang++ compiler can be installed by running the command `xcode-select --install` in a terminal or though the xcode app.
